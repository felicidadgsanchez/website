abstract = {This paper presents a work in progress project that implements a set of tools and systems to allow researchers performing qualitative and quantitative analysis about visual communication in social networks. This analysis is intended to discover learning by imitation patterns, the usage of visual language in non-formal contexts like social networks and to find real examples of visual conversations among users that are not related with the semantic, grammar and vocabulary of the visual language present in the images and visual expressions. In order to explain how researchers are developing these systems and tools, the paper explains an overall introduction to the problem, the aims and objectives for this work in progress, their approach to face the problems raised by this kind of analysis involving images and social networks, and explaining the core concepts related to the tools and systems that they are building to perform the analysis.},
