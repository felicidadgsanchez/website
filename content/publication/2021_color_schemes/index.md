abstract = "The aim of the didactics of color is to create a connection, a state of harmony between the observable color and color which is created. This objective unfolds in the teaching methods employed. On one hand, analytical observation must be taught, allowing the gaze to distinguish different shades of color, to organize hierarchically levels of light and darkness and to evaluate subtleties in the saturation of hues. On the other hand, rigorous instruction in color mixing must ensure that the observable color, that is, the desired color, can be approached in an intuitive and precise way. In this article, the authors discuss the difficulties faced teaching color to student artists and how digital tools can be used for training the concept of observation and the analysis of color. These tools allow color schemes to be created. Here the authors discuss how these tools can be applied, based on the experience obtained in introductory painting classes involving students from the University of Salamanca."
